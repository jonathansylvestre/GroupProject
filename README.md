# GroupProject Outline
Topic 
The data provided presents insight on whether or not potential job candidates truthfully want to work as Data Scientists for the company or are only going through the employment process as a way to obtain free training and use it to land positions elsewhere. Human resource researchers are trying to pinpoint certain factors in these candidates to reduce attrition and save on training expenses.
Abstract
In order to predict the probability of a candidate sticking with the company, explaratory data analysis was done to discover facts about the dataset. A density plot was created on the training hours feature to compare the experience levels of the candidates. It was discovered that the majority of the candidates had less than 50 hours of training in Data Science at the time they began taking courses with the company. The machine learning model that will be used iss Random Over Sampling because the dataset was an apparant class imbalance. In order to gain indepth insight on the model, multiple datasets will be experimented on to discover patterns among features so that HR can make effective decisions in their hiring process.
